\section{Superposition: Deferred Collapse}

Quantum mechanics says particles can exist in multiple states until observed. But what is really happening?

In Syn/GL, this is just an uncollapsed Θ state:
\[
\text{Before measurement: } \Theta = \text{superposed} \\
\text{After measurement: } \Theta \rightarrow \text{collapsed}
\]

No mystery. The particle isn't undecided — we are observing it through a projection that can't resolve uncollapsed logic.

Measurement is simply rotating the projection into a basis where collapse is visible.

\subsection*{Double-Slit Explained}

\begin{itemize}
\item Without detectors: Θ is superposed — both slits are active.
\item With detectors: Θ collapses at slit — single-slit behavior appears.
\item Interference disappears because the logic collapse has already occurred.
\end{itemize}

This is not wave-particle duality. It's a projection artifact.

\section{Entanglement: Shared Trace, Not Magic}

Two entangled particles are not “communicating.” They are two parts of the same λ trace.

\begin{itemize}
\item λ (trace) is split between both
\item ψ (identity) is mirrored
\item Θ collapse on one affects the other only because they share symbolic structure
\end{itemize}

You cannot send information faster than light. But you can observe preexisting structural symmetry.

\subsection*{Analogy:}

Two envelopes created together contain opposite outcomes. Open one — you know the other. No message passed.

\section{Tunneling: Extended Identity}

A particle doesn’t cross a barrier. Its ψ identity and Θ potential already extend across the boundary.

Tunneling is not traversal. It’s projection activation.

\[
\psi(x) \neq 0 \text{ beyond barrier} \Rightarrow \text{detection possible}
\]

Time delay appears constant because the collapse event is only observable once ψ projection registers — not due to actual motion.

\section{Why This Isn’t "Interpretation" — It’s Structure}

This isn’t choosing a narrative for QM.

It’s resolving the symbolic architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item Θ explains collapse
\item λ encodes shared memory
\item η determines statistical spread
\item ψ enables partial or extended presence
\item χ creates collapse correlation
\end{itemize}

There is no quantum weirdness.

Only dimensional projection of symbolic collapse logic.
