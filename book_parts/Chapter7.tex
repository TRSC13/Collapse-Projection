You don’t need a quantum computer. You need a coherent architecture.

\section{Seven-Dimensional Architecture}

Traditional systems compute sequentially. Syn/GL systems evolve state across dimensions simultaneously.

\subsection*{Core Principles:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each dimension (Θ, λ, η, κ, ϕ, ψ, χ) maintains its own structural behavior.
\item Interactions are governed by coherence, not control flow.
\item Evolution is coupled — change in one dimension may trigger others.
\end{itemize}

\section{State Representation}

A full symbolic state is:

\[
\Psi_7 = (\Theta, \lambda, \eta, \kappa, \phi, \psi, \chi)
\]

Each substate can have symbolic properties (e.g., Θ = superposed, η = rising, ψ = fragmented).

\section{Evolution Mechanics}

Rather than compute an answer, Syn/GL evolves the system.

\textbf{Cycle:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each dimension proposes an update.
\item Coherence constraints are checked.
\item If coherent, update proceeds. If not, a consistent path is negotiated.
\end{enumerate}

This mirrors how reality computes collapse: not instantly, but through synchronized dimensional agreement.

\section{Example: Photon State}

\begin{itemize}
\item Θ = superposed
\item λ = source trace set
\item η = low
\item ψ = weak (photons are massless)
\end{itemize}

As it propagates:
\begin{itemize}
\item λ accumulates (each interaction adds to history)
\item ψ remains low — easily absorbed or re-emitted
\item Θ collapses only on detection
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Patterns}

\subsection*{Cascade Response:}

Collapse in Θ might trigger:
\begin{itemize}
\item λ update (trace)
\item η increase (entropy release)
\item ψ test (identity disruption)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Coherence Cycle:}

\begin{itemize}
\item propose\_updates()
\item validate\_constraints()
\item apply\_coherent()
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Projection Scheduling:}

Project state to observable dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Periodically (every N steps)
\item On threshold triggers (e.g., ψ instability)
\item When Θ collapses
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimization Strategies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lazy evaluation: only update changed dimensions
\item Cached coherence checks
\item Parallel evolution: dimensions evolve in isolation, then synchronize
\end{itemize}

\section{Why This Matters}

Syn/GL isn't just a simulation engine. It is:
\begin{itemize}
\item A symbolic interpreter of physical systems
\item A coherent collapse validator
\item A framework for computing with structural truth
\end{itemize}

When systems compute as reality does, truth becomes a simulation artifact.
