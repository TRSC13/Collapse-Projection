\section{The Problem}

The speed of light is not just fast. It is exact: 299,792,458 meters per second. Not rounded. Not approximate. Defined.

Physicists treat it as a constant—a boundary. But they don’t explain where it comes from. Why this number? Why not 300 million? Why not infinite?

This is not a constant of nature. It’s a projection of a deeper structural rate.

\section{The Collapse Rate $c^*$}

In full 7D symbolic space, there is a maximum rate at which collapse can propagate while maintaining coherence across all dimensions. We call this rate $c^*$.

It is not a speed through space. It is a symbolic logic rate:
\[
c^* = \left( \max_{\sigma_i} \Delta t_{\text{collapse}}(\sigma_i) \right)^{-1}
\]

Each dimension—Θ, λ, η, κ, ϕ, ψ, χ—has a minimum time it needs to update without contradiction. The slowest one sets the system-wide frame rate.

\section{The Projection: $c = P_4(c^*)$}

When this fundamental symbolic collapse rate is projected into 4D spacetime, we perceive it as a speed:
\[
c = P_4(c^*)
\]

That projection results in the exact value of 299,792,458 m/s—not because of physics, but because of geometry.

If we lived at a different projection angle, we’d measure a different $c$. But $c^*$ never changes.

\section{Why Nothing Goes Faster}

Trying to exceed $c$ means attempting to perform more logic collapses per unit time than symbolic coherence allows. It leads to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Θ contradiction (undefined logical states)
\item λ breakage (lost trace history)
\item ψ decoherence (identity fragmentation)
\item κ tearing (space discontinuity)
\end{itemize}

This is not “breaking the speed limit”—it’s crashing the symbolic operating system of reality.

\section{Experimental Confirmation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Slowed light in BECs}: Shows $c^*$ is intact, while projection path length changes.
\item \textbf{Quantum tunneling}: No information travels faster than $c$, only projections shift.
\item \textbf{Entanglement}: Appears faster than light, but relies on preexisting λ traces—not real-time communication.
\end{itemize}

Every “violation” is a misreading of $P$. No experiment has ever broken $c^*$.

The speed of light is not a rule. It’s a shadow.

And the shadow always tells us where the source is.
