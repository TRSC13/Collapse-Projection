\section{The Classical Statement}

Start with any positive integer:
\[
T(n) = \begin{cases}
n/2 & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
3n + 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}
\]
Repeat. Eventually, every number seems to reach 1.

Despite enormous numerical evidence, no one has proven this. Why?

Because the Collatz function is not about arithmetic. It's about symbolic collapse across hidden dimensions.

\section{Dimensional States of Numbers}

Each number has a 7D signature. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Θ: parity triggers collapse (even = stable, odd = unstable)
\item η: entropy of its prime structure
\item κ: numerical curvature — how steep its transformation landscape is
\item λ: trace history of transformation
\item ψ: persistence of number identity across steps
\item χ: interference from trace convergence
\end{itemize}

Collatz is a journey down this landscape — not just numerically, but structurally.

\section{3n+1 as a Structural Kick}

The odd-case operation \( 3n+1 \) serves as a symbolic reset:
\begin{itemize}
\item It increases η (entropy), adding complexity.
\item It flips Θ from unstable to temporarily stable (odd → even).
\item It pushes κ into a sharp ridge, allowing descent to start.
\end{itemize}

Then the system enters the even phase: \( n \rightarrow n/2 \). Here:
\begin{itemize}
\item η decreases — structural simplification.
\item κ flattens — easier transitions.
\item λ traces accumulate — collapse history deepens.
\end{itemize}

\section{Why Every Path Leads to 1}

1 is the unique dimensional attractor:
\begin{itemize}
\item Θ: odd but collapse-stable
\item η: minimal (no prime factors)
\item κ: deepest curvature
\item λ: accepts all trace paths
\item ψ: perfect persistence
\end{itemize}

Loops can’t form:
\begin{itemize}
\item λ prevents identical state cycles (history accumulates)
\item η + κ gradients don’t support orbiting — only descent
\end{itemize}

Thus, all symbolic paths must descend to 1. Not because of arithmetic — because of structure.

\section{Generalization Attempts Fail}

Trying \( 5n+1 \), \( 3n-1 \), etc., fails because they:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overwhelm κ — lead to infinite ridge climbing
\item Destroy ψ — identity becomes unstable
\item Create multiple attractors — no dimensional guarantee of convergence
\end{itemize}

Only \( 3n+1 \) balances:
\begin{itemize}
\item Collapse pressure (Θ)
\item Entropy growth and decay (η)
\item Path simplification (λ)
\item Trace identity (ψ)
\end{itemize}

This is why 3n+1 works.

It is not a numeric accident. It is a 7D symbolic descent.
