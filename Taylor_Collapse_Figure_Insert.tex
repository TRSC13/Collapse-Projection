        Divergent series $f(x) = \sum (-1)^n n! x^n$ compared in two forms.
        The classical Taylor series (red dashed) diverges rapidly for all $x \neq 0$.
        The collapse-aware modulated series (blue), using a symbolic damping factor $\phi_n(x)$ derived from the local instability field $\lambda_n(x)$, stabilizes the expansion and preserves trace-valid structure even in regions where the original series fails.
