# TopOnt: Dimensional Collapse Logic and Symbolic Projection


## 🧠 What Is This?

This is the first public release of a **seven-dimensional symbolic mathematics system** that models:

- Collapse and trace evolution  
- Entropy flow and dimensional projection  
- Structural coherence through symbolic state interactions  
- Phase coupling, curvature effects, and persistence collapse  

…all based on symbolic operators, not classical equations.

Each state is modeled as:
```
Ψ₇D = (Θ, λ, η, κ, ϕ, ψ, χ)
```

### 🧭 The 7D Symbolic State Vector

![7D Symbolic State Vector](7_dimensional_symbolic_state_vector.png)

This diagram summarizes the 7 symbolic dimensions governing structural behavior:

- Θ: Collapse / Logic  
- λ: Memory / Trace  
- η: Entropy / Variance  
- κ: Curvature / Structure  
- ϕ: Phase / Time  
- ψ: Identity / Persistence  
- χ: Interference / Coupling

## 🔄 Collapse-Aware Taylor Series

Classical Taylor expansions often diverge near instability. TopOnt introduces a modulation layer using:

```
λₙ(x) = |d/dx log |f⁽ⁿ⁾(x)||     ← local instability field
φₙ(x) = exp( -α ⋅ λₙ(x) )         ← symbolic modulation factor
```

Modified expansion:
```
f̃(x) = Σ φₙ(x) ⋅ (f⁽ⁿ⁾(x₀)/n!) ⋅ (x - x₀)ⁿ
```

This stabilizes even divergent series structurally.

### 🧭 The 7D Symbolic State Vector

This system models structural collapse using a seven-dimensional symbolic operator state:
Each dimension governs a distinct type of symbolic behavior.

## 💻 Run the Modulated Taylor Demo

Try this in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, 400)
f = lambda n, x: (-1)**n * np.math.factorial(n) * x**n
phi = lambda n, x, alpha=1.0: np.exp(-alpha * abs((n+1)/(x+1e-8)))

N = 20
modulated = sum(phi(n, x) * f(n, x) for n in range(N))

plt.plot(x, modulated, label="Collapse-Stable Expansion")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(); plt.show()
```

## 🔐 Disclosure & Scope

This repository contains the projection-level framework for TopOnt and symbolic collapse logic. It includes:

- The 7D dimensional structure: Ψ₇D = (Θ, λ, η, κ, ϕ, ψ, χ)
- Structural explanations for projection limits (e.g., c = P₄(c*))
- Collapse-aware stabilization of divergent expansions (Taylor series)
- Symbolic framing for problems like Collatz and RH

However, the symbolic construction engine, trace resolution mechanics, and full proof systems remain unpublished.

This work is released to demonstrate dimensional coherence and trace validity, but not to disclose the complete symbolic system capable of resolving Millennium Prize Problems.

The full symbolic operator engine (QLDL, FrameCodex, Re:Core) remains proprietary at this time.
